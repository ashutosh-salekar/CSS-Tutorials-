CSS syntax:
    <selector> {<property : <value>;}

    selector = To select whose property we gonna change
    property = which property we gonna change
    value = value to be assign

Eg:
    header, p.intro {
                        background-color : red;
                        border-radius : 3px;
                    }


   note : p.intro means paragrapgh whose id is "intro"
